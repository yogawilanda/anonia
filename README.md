# Anonia

HELLO WORLD!

![](https://github.com/yogawilanda/anonia/blob/master/Covers.png)

This app is my first-well-concerned to develope, since I start code on this project since I can't even code properly with my self taught. I hope someone will help me to improve it! :D

Ah, right, at first let me tell what about this app gonna works.

It is a basically a chat app anyway, nothing more fancy. But I try to add some random chat alike function which will connect people around the world. So you can login as a Anonymous person or if you want easy-to-go. Try login with Google.

This seems had a long way to be published since there is a bunch of things i need to build and test it again.
Ah right, i will update this readme as the things clears up on my thought about how this app is going.
